      <h2>Database Migration Intern @ Virtusa</h2>
      <p>
        Interned at Virtusa from June 16 to July 16, 2025. I was part of a database migration project that involved
        transitioning legacy data to a more scalable and modular architecture. The system used a hybrid tech stack
        including Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Python, MySQL, and Angular. My main responsibility was writing unit tests
        for SQL queries and data access logic to ensure data accuracy and integrity after migration. I tested CRUD
        operations, joins, and edge cases using frameworks in Python and Ruby. I also coordinated with backend teams
        to validate that the queries behaved correctly across various API layers. The project was monitored using
        a custom Angular-based dashboard for tracking test coverage and migration progress. This internship helped
        strengthen my skills in query validation, test writing, and collaborative development within a large codebase.
